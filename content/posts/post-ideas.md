## Post ideas

- [x] Bring across [this Medium post](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/exploring-melbournes-myki-data-with-aws-athena-511410d2e461) on Melbourne Myki data
- [ ] Exploring high availability of multi-AZ ALBs https://github.com/tomwwright/aws-multi-az-load-balancers
- [ ] Repository pattern in TypeScript with DynamoDB https://github.com/tomwwright/dynamodb-repository-pattern
- [ ] Analysis of ECS Fargate deployment performance https://github.com/tomwwright/aws-ecs-deployment-analysis
- [ ] CONSTANT VIGILANCE. On planning defensively, avoiding complacency, and making tradeoffs on known efforts to mitigate unknown risks. i.e. deploying Vault to decouple production-au from ECST effort which ended up running late by a couple months

## My codes

```js
dfdfd = "fgfg"
const x = 3
```

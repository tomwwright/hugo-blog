You want to get better? Do the reps.
It's an attraction notion that we only need to know how to be better, to be better. It's generally easily understood that you don't become a great soccer player or pianist by someone explaining to you what to do, but for some reason this idea pops up a lot in software. "If I'm just connected with the right knowledge of how to do this, my problems are solved."

No. Unfortunately, to be better, you have to do the reps.

It's easy to argue that my examples above are highly physical, and that the reps are only necessary to train the right movements and physical reactions. But consider this: your brain can also react to information, and the flow of information in problem solving is precisely the sorts of "reactions" we need to embed and make unconscious.

How many times have you said to yourself, "Oh, that was a mistake. I know better than that." Yes, but you did it anyway.

You need to be consistent and you need to do the reps.

What are the reps? What are the basic, atomic activities you need to do to succeed? Write a test, raise a pull request. Document a bug, refine a Jira ticket. These are all activities that you need to train yourself to do well. **And training yourself means (1) working out what good looks like and (2) doing the reps. You won't change your behaviours by learning something once. You need to embed the change through repetition and consistency. You need it to be automatic that you write a good test or submit a clear pull request. You can't be _thinking_ about these things, because you need those brain cycles to work on the higher level parts of your problem.** You need it to _feel_ wrong when you've missed something, because you don't have the attention to spare to analyse for the fault.

Getting to that next stage isn't about the thing you don't know how to do, the part of the project you haven't worked on, the process at work you aren't a part of yet. Getting to the next stage is about making what currently takes you time and focus to do and making that automatic. When it is automatic, your brain will already start working on the next level up.

Great football players don't think about executing great handballs they think about executing a strategy to win the game. At practice, they drill and drill and drill to embed and make automatic the reactions they need to **perform tactics** and **execute strategy**.

### Intuition isn't unknowable

This isn't to say that great software engineering can't be explained, or great football can't be explained. It absolutely can be analysed, critiqued, and improved. You absolutely should be able to explain why your factored a function that way, or why you did or did not include a bit of information on your pull request. But at the end of the day, you can't explain it to someone else and have them write pull requests like you tomorrow -- learning just doesn't work that way. If it did, we'd all be great.

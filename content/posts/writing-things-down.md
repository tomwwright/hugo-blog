I've been meaning to create a new space to post things for a while. I have a lot of thoughts about how software is built and how teams work together. I find myself sharing these thoughts a lot with people in conversation, but _I never seem to write them down_.

Writing things down allows you to **save yourself the trouble of repeating yourself**. Some HTML on the internet is available to an interested party 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and is also **less likely to shit the bed in articulating** whatever wisp of experience or wisdom was on offer because it hasn't had any coffee yet.

Writing things down also **forces you to make sense** because words have to be `written. one. at. a. time.` This means that your wild, wooly thoughts must be `serialised. into. a. sequence. of. coherent. information` that is useful to another human being. Thoughts are fragile, vague, and complex, and words often feel sort of blocky and obtuse by comparison, so this process is difficult. Inevitably, it leads to a first attempt that on review feels like:

> Oh, wow, nobody could decipher or absorb anything useful out of this, and I have no idea what I'm talking about

While daunting, having this reaction is **an act of :sparkles: _empathy_ :sparkles: towards your audience**. And thankfully, unlike a conversation, you can _just rewrite it_. You will often find that it wasn't that the words were too obtuse, it was that **the thoughts were too vague**.

Writing things down, by necessity, allows us to refine and clarify our own thoughts on the matter at hand.

## What will I write down?

Some aspirations:

_A portfolio_ -- I'd like to have a space to catalogue and present some of the ~~useless crap~~ software I've built over the years because each project, even if unfinished, was part my journey with software.

_Professional learnings and experience_ -- I'd like to do a better job of preserving the hard-won lessons that each day offers in case they're useful to someone else, or even myself down the line. Having recently been through the experience again of interviewing for a new job, it would be nice to have record of some scrap of profundity.

_Less, but more often_ -- I really admire [this blog](https://www.bradenmoore.net/) by a former colleague of mine, Braden Moore. Many of the posts are short, and that in no way diminishes them.

_I don't know yet_ -- I'd like to build the habit, and see where it takes me.

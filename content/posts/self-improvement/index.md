The key to improvement is having a definition for what good looks like.

<!--more-->

This goes for self improvement of yourself or for improvement of something else like software.

I often hear people lament that they "aren't driven enough to get better". Similarly, often people suggest at work that they would succeed if only the software or tools they are working with were "better".  

But what is better? Can you define it? If you can't define it, then no amount of drive or effort is going to realise the goals that you have.

## Too much improvement

Having a definition for good also allows you to find "good enough". Too much drive or motivation, without a model for "good enough", can produce obsessiono or fixation that untimately aren't useful.

## Many facets

This is particularly important when we consider we rarely have one thing we need to achieve, grow, or improve. When juggling 100 facets, knowing when we have reached "good enough" is key.
